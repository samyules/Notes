## Keep moving

Perfection is not the goal. There is no *end state*. There is only motion. Backwards or forwards. That is all. I am beginning to see that the most important thing is to keep moving (hopefully forward). If you stop, then you are truly going backwards.

I often get lost in the function of the tool, and end up ever actually using it for anything. I feel like I am constantly getting distracted with bells and whistles, and I never end up going anywhere.

I suppose that at the moment, I am atleast doing *something*. Even if I feel like I am treading water. At least I am not drowning.

## The tools
- Obsidian is a great tool, with sooo many bells and whistles.
	The most important part is whether you actually use it!
- Templater is great, but I hate the useless error messages.

## Going forward

I hope to remain in motion in the correct direction.
