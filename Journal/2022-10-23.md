## What are some things that happened today?

Hilary lost over a thousand dollars today. The day started remarkably well. For once in a blue moon we managed to get up with plenty of time to spare. We made it to church on time (which never happens). Afterwards, we ate lunch, I made it downstairs and got work done. Then shit hit the fan. Hilary is missing a bag full of money that despite my concern she has been carrying around in her purse.
