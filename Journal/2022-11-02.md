## Journal

I am trying to figure out a different way use `git` with `Obsidian`. Right now, I am manually running `git pull`, `git commit -m "message"`, and `git push`. This works, but it requires a lot of manual intervention. I would like the process to be smoother. 
1. I am going to move my vault into `iCloud` and use iCloud to keep the vault synced on my apple devices. 
2. I am using syncthing to keep my vault synced with my `Galaxy Tab S7+`. Using git on the shared storage location through termux was resulting in **lost data**. Syncthing is proving to be superior; it is more convenient and fault tolerant.
3. I would like to continue to use git to keep my notes as a backup.
	- Write a script to use fswatch to trigger `git add .`, `git commit -m "filename timestamp"`, and `git push`.
