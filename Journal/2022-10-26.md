## Journal

Read:: [[Nix Flakes-first steps|Nix Flakes: first steps]]

Still trying to figure out Daily notes and templates.

### 12:29 Built a template for [[Article Template|Article Notes]]. Also [[Templates/Book|book notes]].
  Book notes outline taken from https://filipedonadio.com//6-useful-templates-for-obsidian/.

13:38 Figured out how to resize images in obsidian:
    `![AltText|100x100](path/to/image.png)`
    To keep aspect ratio, omit the width. eg:
    `![AltText|100](path/to/image.png)`
    See [Resize image - Help - Obsidian Forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/resize-image/6517)

## Tasks

- [ ] Oil change on Explorer

## How did the day go?



## What can you do better?
I need to build a better Journal template.
