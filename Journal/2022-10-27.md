## Thinking

I have a problem capturing my ideas and thoughts. I think that just writing in this everyday will help. I think that I am headed in the right direction. If I can capture enough, then maybe I can bulld something useful.

The other problem is, I have an obsession with the tools. I am that guy who will try and find *the perfect tool*. I will perseverate over the details of what the tool does, how it is constructed, where it was made, the finish, the grip, the details. I will spend soooo much time stressing about the tool that I will **never** actually *use* the tool.

I must start to use the tools. It doesn't matter if the tool is perfect. I just need to move forward.

## What can you do better?

Use the tools that are in front of you. Find a direction. Go that direction.
