![[The Story Of Halloween.m4a]]

Tomorrow is Halloween!  This morning I looked up this old record. I used to sit for hours on the floor in front of my parents record player listening to this s story. I'm not sure what drew me into this old story, but I loved it! I would close my eyes and picture the old southern mansion, in the dark of a thunderstorm, a ghost horse wandering through the yard under the old tree.
