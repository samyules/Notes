# OODA Loops

In a battlefield environment, the organization that is better at OODA will win.

## What is OODA?
1. **Observe**
    - It's not who has the most information, or the best view. It's who is better at identifying patterns.
2. **Orient**
    - This is the most important part of the loop. It's about choosing the best course of action, on the fly. *McGuiver*ing
3. **Decide**
4. **Act**
