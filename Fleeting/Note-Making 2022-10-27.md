There is [[note-taking]] and there is **note-making**.

# Note-Making

Active method of mindfully taking notes using your own words. Focus on the action that matters while filtering out the noise. We don't always know what we will generate, and you give yourself the opportunity to create things you never imagined. **Note-making** encourages you to explore your sparks of curiosity; to follow the trail to new discoveries. 

## Five Prompts 
1. Find things. Notice when you say *That's interesting*.
2. Instead of collecting that thing, say *That reminds me*.
    1. *That reminds me* changes your mentality from taking to **making**.
3. *It"s similar because...*
4. *It's different because...*
5. *It's i important because...*
    1. Why was this thing interesting? Why did you pick that one thing out of the air?
