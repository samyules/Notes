Created 19 Oct 2022 14:30

Zettelkasten Smart Notes is a method of storing information, and *digesting* it to find additional meaning and insights. 

### Fleeting Notes
As you read something you might highlight passages, as you watch a youtube video you might write down interesting information as you hear it. Those are example of fleeting notes. They are quick and easy to take. They are not meant to be complete ideas, but they are a way of storing the raw information that you find interesting or important.

### Literature Notes
These notes a little more in depth. Literature notes are not just a copy or expansion of your fleeting notes. Rather they are a compendium of your own understanding of something. **Why is something *interesting* to you? Why is it important?** 

### Permanent Notes
When taking permanent notes, you should create a map of individual ideas that create a larger picture of understanding. This is kind of difficult to express, but the goal is to create larger *networks* of understanding. 

Just try it sometime, okay?
